# 🧩 ---- Sudoku Game in C ---- 🧩

This project is a console-based Sudoku game written in C, which allows players to generate Sudoku boards of 3 available sizes and 3 difficulty levels.

## 🕹️ Game Rules 🕹️
Sudoku is a classic number puzzle where the objective is to fill a square board with digits from 1 to n (n = board size) following these rules:
	•	Each digit must appear exactly once in each row
	•	Each digit must appear exactly once in each column
	•	Each digit must appear exactly once in each √n × √n subgrid (box)

e.g. A standard 9×9 board is divided into 3×3 subgrids (boxes). At the start of the game, some cells are already filled in — these are the hints. Your mission is to complete the rest of the board according to the rules.
