# üß© ---- Sudoku Game in C ---- üß©

This project is a console-based Sudoku game written in C, which allows players to generate Sudoku boards of 3 available sizes and 3 difficulty levels.

## üïπÔ∏è Game Rules üïπÔ∏è
Sudoku is a classic number puzzle where the objective is to fill a square board with digits from 1 to n (n = board size) following these rules:
	‚Ä¢	Each digit must appear exactly once in each row
	‚Ä¢	Each digit must appear exactly once in each column
	‚Ä¢	Each digit must appear exactly once in each ‚àön √ó ‚àön subgrid (box)

e.g. A standard 9√ó9 board is divided into 3√ó3 subgrids (boxes). At the start of the game, some cells are already filled in ‚Äî these are the hints, and the player‚Äôs task is to complete the rest of the board according to the rules.
